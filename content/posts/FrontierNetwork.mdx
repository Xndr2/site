### Hi, yall!

I'm excited to share what I've been working on: **Frontier Network**, a Minecraft server network that takes traditional skyblock gameplay and turns it into something much more intense.

## The Concept

Frontier Network is currently in active development at [frontiernetwork.be](https://frontiernetwork.be), and the flagship gamemode is **Frontier Realms**; a unique blend of skyblock and extraction-based gameplay. Think of it as "Tarkov meets Minecraft skyblock."

The premise is simple: Enter dangerous realms to gather resources and loot. Extract successfully and keep everything. Die, and you lose it all.
What makes Frontier Realms different from traditional skyblock is the extraction mechanic.

## Five Realms

Each realm offers different challenges and rewards:

- **Ice Realm**: Frozen tundra with rare minerals
- **Nether Realm**: Volcanic hellscape with rare ores  
- **Jungle Realm**: Dense wilderness hiding ancient temples
- **Desert Realm**: Ancient ruins buried beneath the sand
- **Dungeon Realm**: Structured challenges with boss fights

## Islands

Players can team up through the guild system, building shared guild islands and tackling realms together. Each player also gets their own personal island.

## Technical Architecture

Under the hood, Frontier Realms runs on a custom Paper plugin I built from scratch. More about this in a future post.

## Beyond Realms

While Frontier Realms is the flagship mode, the network also hosts:

- **Minigames**: PvP Duels, Sumo, Spleef, TNT Run, and more
- **Survival**: Classic survival with economy and land claiming

## Current Status

The server is currently in active development, running on Java Edition 1.21.10 & 1.21.11. We're building out the community and refining the core gameplay loop based on player feedback.

## What's Next

I'm planning to write more technical deep-dives about this in the future. More smaller updates can be found in our discord server.

All the love ❤️ - Xander
