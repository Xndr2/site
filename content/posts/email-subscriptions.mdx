Quick one. You can now subscribe to this blog by email.

There's a form at the bottom of every post (and on the [blog page](/blog)). Drop your email in, confirm the link that lands in your inbox, and you're set. Whenever I publish something new, you'll get a short email with the title and a link. That's it.

No weekly digests, no "we thought you'd also like..." nonsense. Just a ping when there's something new to read.

And if you change your mind, every email has a one-click unsubscribe link. No hoops.

All the love - Xander
