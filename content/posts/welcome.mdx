Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to finally have a space where I can share my thoughts on game development, programming, and the various projects I'm working on.

## What to Expect

Here's what you can look forward to:

- **Game Development Insights**: Tips and lessons learned from working on Abandoned and other projects
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Explorations of interesting programming challenges
- **Project Updates**: Behind-the-scenes looks at what I'm building
- **Tool Recommendations**: Software and resources that have helped me

## About Me

I'm a self-taught developer from Belgium, currently working as Project Lead at Headshot Interactive on our game *Abandoned*. I specialize in:

- Game development with Unreal Engine
- Web development with Next.js and React
- Various programming languages including C++, C#, and TypeScript
